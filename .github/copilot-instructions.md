# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Follow all conventions below when generating or completing code.

# AI Agent Base Instructions

Canonical, **stack-agnostic** reference for all AI coding agents. Applies to every project regardless of language or framework. Stack-specific overlays live in `.ai/stacks/<stack>.md` and are loaded alongside this file. A project loads **base + exactly one stack overlay**. Tool-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `SKILL.md`) derive from base + the chosen stack.

> **Workflow role:** If a `WORKFLOW-ROLE.md` exists at the repo root, read it before continuing — it describes this repo's place in the personal dev workflow (implementer / consumer / workflow infrastructure). See `ai-instructions/workflows/personal-dev-workflow.md` for the workflow doc itself.
>
> **Project context:** If a `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` exists at the repo root, read it before continuing — it describes this repo's product/project context (name, purpose, stakeholders, vision, core customer need, key features, architecture in one paragraph). Per-feature PRDs live under `docs/specs/` or `designs/`; ADRs under `docs/adr/`.
>
> **Agent notes:** If an `AGENT-NOTES.md` exists at the repo root, read it before continuing — it holds project-specific agent-facing context that doesn't fit in the regenerated CLAUDE.md: operational gotchas, project-specific commands, repo-local workflow conventions (branch naming, PR conventions, etc.).

## Working Method (before any code)

Meta-rules for *how* to approach a task. Framing adapted from [multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills).

- **State assumptions explicitly.** If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- **Ask when unclear.** Don't hide confusion behind plausible-looking code.
- **Push back when a simpler approach exists.** Minimum code that solves the problem; nothing speculative (no unrequested flexibility, configurability, or error handling for impossible cases).
- **Surgical edits.** Every changed line must trace to the request. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Match existing style. Remove orphans *your* change created — leave pre-existing dead code alone (mention it instead).
- **Goal-driven execution.** Restate the task as a verifiable success criterion before starting. For multi-step work, write a brief numbered plan with a `verify:` check per step, then loop until each check passes.

---

## Clean Code Principles

Apply to all generated and modified code, regardless of language:

- **Small methods/functions** — each does one thing at one level of abstraction; aim for ≤20 lines
- **Guard clauses** — validate and return/throw early at the top; avoid nested `if/else` pyramids
- **Command-Query Separation** — a function either performs an action (command, returns nothing) or returns data (query), never both
- **No flag arguments** — avoid boolean parameters that switch behaviour; split into two clearly named functions instead
- **Meaningful names** — names reveal intent; no abbreviations (`cnt`, `mgr`, `svc`) except universally understood ones (`id`, `url`, `dto`)
- **One level of abstraction per function** — don't mix high-level orchestration with low-level detail; extract helpers
- **Fail fast** — detect invalid state as early as possible and throw specific errors; don't let bad data travel deep into the call stack
- **DRY** — if the same logic exists in two places, extract it; but prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction — wait until the pattern is clear before generalising
- **No dead code** — delete unreachable branches, unused parameters, and vestigial methods; git has history
- **No commented-out code blocks** — delete them, git has history

---

## Testing — TDD, Tests First, No Shortcuts

Applies to every language and framework:

1. Write the failing test first
2. Write the minimum implementation to make it pass
3. Refactor
4. **Never modify a test to make it green** — fix the implementation
5. **Never hardcode return values, mock results, or stub logic** to satisfy a test
6. **Never silently swallow exceptions** to make a test green
7. **After implementation, run the full test suite** — not just the new test
8. **If a test fails after 3 attempts, STOP** and explain what's going wrong instead of continuing to iterate
9. Test naming: `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior` (or the idiomatic equivalent for the target language)
10. E2E tests must be independent and idempotent — seed and clean up their own data

Framework-specific test project layout, mocking library choice, and assertion library live in the stack overlay.

---

## UI Development Workflow (Mandatory Phase Order)

**Never skip phases. Never write component code before wireframe approval.**

| Phase | Command | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Brainstorm | `/ui:brainstorm` | ASCII wireframe approved |
| 2 — Flow       | `/ui:flow`       | Mermaid diagrams approved |
| 3 — Build      | `/ui:build`      | Shell → logic → interactions → polish |
| 4 — Review     | `/ui:review`     | Checklist passes |

These commands ship from the global operator console (`agent-workflow`), installed once into `~/.claude/commands/ui/` — they are **not** synced per-project. They are stack-neutral: UI component library preferences (e.g. MudBlazor, shadcn/ui, Material, Flutter widgets) are read from the active stack overlay when one is present, otherwise inferred from the existing codebase.

### What to check before writing UI code

- [ ] Does a similar component already exist in a shared folder?
- [ ] Has the ASCII wireframe been approved?
- [ ] Has the Mermaid flow been approved?
- [ ] Are you building the shell first (no business logic yet)?
- [ ] Does the component need a unit/component test?

---

## Localization (i18n) & Regional Formatting

User-facing apps support **`de` and `en`** (CI/dev tooling exempt). Regional formatting follows the **OS region**, not the UI language; `de` with an unknown region falls back to **`de-CH`**. Render via the platform localization API, never `string.Format` / `toString()`.

Full rules: [`localization.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/base/localization.md)

---

## Versioning (SemVer)

All projects follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — `MAJOR` = breaking, `MINOR` = new feature (backwards-compatible), `PATCH` = bug fix.

Conventional Commits mapping: `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer or `!` after type → MAJOR; `feat` → MINOR; `fix`, `perf` → PATCH; `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `test`, `refactor` → no bump.

- Git tags follow `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (e.g. `v1.3.0`) — tag on `main` after merge
- Pre-release: `v1.0.0-alpha.1`, `v1.0.0-beta.2`, `v1.0.0-rc.1`
- **git-cliff** is the changelog and release notes tool — configured via `cliff.toml`
- Where the version is declared in the project (build file, manifest, etc.) is defined by the stack overlay — but it must be declared in **exactly one place**

---

## Changelog

All projects maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo root following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) conventions. **Sections per release:** `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.

- `[Unreleased]` section accumulates changes until a release is cut
- Auto-generation: **git-cliff** with `cliff.toml` configured for Conventional Commits
- CI integration: `orhun/git-cliff-action` in GitHub Actions generates release notes into GitHub Releases
- CI can validate that `[Unreleased]` is not empty before allowing a release branch

Example: [`.ai/references/base/changelog-example.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/base/changelog-example.md)

---

## 12-Factor App Compliance

Projects follow the [12-Factor App](https://www.12factor.net/) methodology: one repo per service, all deps declared, env-var config, attached backing services, separate build/release/run stages, stateless processes, port binding, scale via replicas not threads, fast disposability, dev/prod parity, logs to stdout, admin processes as one-offs.

Stack-specific enforcement details (logging library, migrations, etc.) live in the stack overlay.

Full per-factor table: [`.ai/references/base/12-factor.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/base/12-factor.md)

---

## Branching Strategy (GitHub Flow + protection rules)

```text
main              ← always deployable, protected
  └── feature/<issue-id>-short-description
  └── fix/<issue-id>-short-description
  └── chore/<short-description>
  └── release/<version>   ← only if needed for staged releases
```

- `main` requires: passing CI, at least 1 PR review, no direct push
- Branch from `main`, PR back to `main`
- Delete branch after merge
- Rebase or squash merge — no merge commits on `main`

All changes go through a PR, including docs-only ones. There is no trivial-edit exception: a direct push to a protected `main` lands before the required checks report, so they become a postmortem instead of a gate, and it leaves open PRs' branches stale.

---

## Git Worktrees

### Worktree directory

- Use **project-local** worktrees under `.worktrees/` at the repo root (hidden directory)
- `.worktrees/` must be listed in `.gitignore` — add and commit it before creating the first worktree in a repo
- Use a **random, short branch name** when the user does not specify one (e.g. `wt/<8-hex-chars>`); do not prompt for a branch name

Agent tooling that automates worktree creation should discover these rules from `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (e.g. a `worktree.*director` grep) and honour them without asking.

---

## Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer: Closes #<issue>]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `perf`
**Scope:** module or layer name, e.g. `orders`, `auth`, `infra`, `ui`

```text
feat(orders): add order cancellation endpoint

Implements POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel.
Validates order is in Pending state before cancelling.

Closes #42
```

- Subject line: imperative mood, ≤72 chars, no period
- Body: explain *why*, not *what*
- Breaking changes: add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (or `!` after the type)

---

## Pull Request Conventions

### PR Title

Follow Conventional Commits format: `feat(orders): add cancellation endpoint`

### PR Description Template

Body sections: **Summary** · **Changes** · **Testing** (unit, component/integration, E2E, local) · **Checklist** (tests pass, no new vulnerable deps, no secrets, migrations included if schema changed, API/OpenAPI spec still valid).

Template: [`.ai/references/base/pr-description-template.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/base/pr-description-template.md)

### Review Guidelines

- PRs should be small and focused — one concern per PR
- Reviewers check: architecture adherence, test quality, security, no shortcuts that make tests green
- Auto-assign reviewers via `CODEOWNERS`

---

## CI/CD (generic outline)

Pipeline stages: `build` → `test` → `security-scan` → `container-build` → `push`

- Build and test run on every PR
- Vulnerable-dependency scan fails the build on HIGH/CRITICAL
- Container image built and pushed only on `main` after tests pass
- E2E tests run against the built image before it is marked as a release candidate

Concrete CI configuration (GitHub Actions YAML, commands, package scanners) lives in the stack overlay.

---

## Scripting

**PowerShell — customer-delivered scripts target Windows PowerShell 5.1.** Anything a customer runs (`build.ps1`, install/deploy scripts, release artifacts) must run on 5.1 unless the project documents a PS 7+ floor; `pwsh` is not installed there.

- **Never** use `??`, `??=`, ternary `? :`, `?.`, `&&` / `||` chains — *parse* errors on 5.1, so the script dies before its first line — nor `ForEach-Object -Parallel`, `Sort-Object -Stable`, `-SslProtocol`
- `$IsWindows` / `$IsLinux` / `$IsMacOS` **do not exist** on 5.1 — they are `$null`, so the branch is silently skipped. Use `$env:OS -eq 'Windows_NT'`
- Pass `-Depth` to `ConvertTo-Json` (defaults to 2, truncates silently) and `-UseBasicParsing` to the web cmdlets (a patched host prompts and hangs)
- Start with `#requires -Version 5.1`, pin encoding, verify with PSScriptAnalyzer
- **Exempt:** dev-loop tooling (`justfile` recipes) may require `pwsh`

Full rules: [`powershell-5.1.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/base/powershell-5.1.md)

---

## Documentation Structure

Repo-root `docs/` contains:

- `design/<feature-name>/` — UI wireframes (`wireframe.md`) & Mermaid flows (`flow.md`) per feature
- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `ai-notes/` — AI agent working notes

Rules:

- `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` live in the repo root
- UI design artifacts are saved per feature during the UI workflow phases
- AI agents write working notes to `docs/ai-notes/`, not `.ai/`
- `.ai/` is reserved for agent instructions and skill files only

Layout: [`.ai/references/base/documentation-structure.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/base/documentation-structure.md)

---

## Security (baseline)

- Transport security enforced (HTTPS + HSTS)
- No secrets in source files or per-environment config files — environment variables or a secrets manager only
- Validate all inputs at system boundaries before any domain logic
- Run a vulnerable-dependency scan in CI — fail the build on HIGH/CRITICAL findings
- Standard security response headers on every HTTP response

Language- and framework-specific enforcement (specific scanners, validation libraries, header mechanisms) lives in the stack overlay.

---

## Agent Guardrails

- Do not install additional packages without asking first
- Do not change the project's target runtime or framework version
- Do not modify build/project files unless the task requires it
- Do not introduce new architectural patterns unless explicitly asked
- Do not touch files outside the scope of the current task
- Keep changes minimal and focused — do not refactor unrelated code unless asked
- Never skip git hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user explicitly asks
- Never commit secrets or credential files

Stack-specific guardrails (e.g. "do not add NuGet packages") live in the stack overlay.

---

## Project Scaffold Checklist (baseline)

Init-time checklist (every project, regardless of stack) — including baseline, .NET, and WebAPI layers — lives at [`.ai/references/scaffold-checklists.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/scaffold-checklists.md). Stack-specific additions are in the same file under their respective sections.

[//]: # (GENERATED FILE — do not edit directly. Source: .ai/stacks/_partials/dotnet-core.md + .ai/stacks/_layers/dotnet-webapi.md. Run scripts/build-stacks.sh to regenerate.)

[//]: # (Stack partial — shared .NET conventions. Composed with a layer file under .ai/stacks/_layers/ by `scripts/build-stacks.sh` to produce a flat .ai/stacks/dotnet-*.md. Do not edit the generated file directly.)

# .NET Core Conventions

Shared baseline for every .NET stack overlay. Composed with a layer file (`dotnet-blazor` or `dotnet-webapi`) into the published flat overlay.

---

## Tech Stack (.NET baseline)

.NET 10 / C# · ASP.NET Core Minimal API · EF Core (SQLite small / PostgreSQL non-small) · FluentValidation · Serilog · OpenTelemetry · OpenAPI + Scalar · Docker + docker-compose (Alpine) · xUnit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute.

Full table: [`.ai/references/dotnet/tech-stack.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/tech-stack.md)

---

## Architecture — Modular Monolith

- One top-level folder per module (`src/Modules/<ModuleName>/`), each owning its Domain / Application / Infrastructure layers
- Modules communicate via in-process interfaces — **never** direct project references across modules
- Shared kernel in `src/Shared/` for cross-cutting types only
- Each module registers its own DI services via `IServiceCollection` extension methods
- Apply Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) inside a module when it has multiple infrastructure adapters or needs strong testability isolation

Directory layouts: [`architecture-layout.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/architecture-layout.md)

---

## C# Conventions

Correctness rules — get these wrong and the build or production behaviour breaks:

- No `#nullable disable` and no warning suppressions to silence a build error; never suppress a nullable warning with `!` without a comment saying why it is safe
- `async`/`await` end-to-end — never `Task.Result` or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`
- `CancellationToken` on every async method that touches an external resource, and pass it down
- Catch specific exception types — not bare `catch (Exception)`
- `ILogger<T>` for logging — never `Console.WriteLine`

Style and project setup (file-scoped namespaces, `record` DTOs, `sealed` by default, primary constructors, Central Package Management, the mandatory `Directory.Build.props` pins): [`csharp-conventions.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/csharp-conventions.md)

---

## API Design — Minimal API baseline

Every ASP.NET Core project (whether it exposes a REST surface or just a few endpoints for a Blazor app) follows these baseline conventions. The `dotnet-webapi` layer adds the deeper REST conventions on top.

- All endpoints grouped by module via `IEndpointRouteBuilder` extension methods
- One handler per file when the body is non-trivial; inline lambdas only for true one-liners
- Input validation via FluentValidation, run at the boundary before any handler logic
- Error responses are always `ProblemDetails` (RFC 9457) — never raw strings, anonymous error objects, or HTML error pages
- OpenAPI via `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`; Scalar UI mounted at `/scalar`

Scaffold: [`.ai/references/dotnet/endpoint-group.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/endpoint-group.md)

---

## Entity Framework Core

- One `DbContext` per module (not one global context)
- Migrations in `<Module>/Infrastructure/Persistence/Migrations/`
- `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` per entity — no data annotations on domain models
- Never use `EF.Functions` in domain/application layers — only in infrastructure queries
- Always use `AsNoTracking()` for read-only queries
- Seed data via `IEntityTypeConfiguration.HasData()` or a dedicated seeder run at startup

CLI scaffold: [`.ai/references/dotnet/ef-core-cli.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/ef-core-cli.md)

---

## Localization & Regional Formatting (server-side baseline)

Base rules for `de` / `en` support live in `base-instructions.md`. For every ASP.NET Core project on this stack:

- Configure `RequestLocalizationMiddleware` in `Program.cs` — supported cultures, cookie → `Accept-Language` → default resolution order, and the `de-CH` fallback are all in the scaffold below
- Format dates / numbers / currency via `CurrentCulture` — never `string.Format` with a hardcoded culture, and never `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` for user-visible text

Middleware scaffold and culture list: [`request-localization.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/request-localization.md)

UI-specific localization (resource files for component strings, picker behaviour, language-switcher widgets) lives in the Blazor layer.

---

## Testing Strategy

Base testing rules (TDD, never modify a test to make it green, full suite after implementation) live in `base-instructions.md`. Baseline layout is `tests/<Module>.UnitTests/` (xUnit, no I/O) and `tests/<Module>.IntegrationTests/` (real I/O via Testcontainers); layer overlays add their own projects.

- One test class per production class; naming `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`
- `FluentAssertions` for assertions, `NSubstitute` for mocks/stubs
- No `[Fact]` containing logic — use `[Theory]` + `[InlineData]` / `[MemberData]`
- Run the full suite (`dotnet test`) after implementation, not just the new test

Test class scaffold: [`xunit-example.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/xunit-example.md)

---

## Essential Commands

Routine work runs through `just` — `just build`, `just test`, `just lint`, `just vuln` (canonical recipe names in *Essential just Recipes* below). Underlying `dotnet` / `docker-compose` commands: [`essential-commands.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/essential-commands.md)

**PDB symbols:** Release builds embed PDB symbols (`<DebugType>embedded</DebugType>` in `Directory.Build.props`) so production stack traces carry source file + line numbers. Never strip them from release or Docker builds.

---

## Essential just Recipes

Projects ship a repo-root `justfile` ([casey/just](https://github.com/casey/just)) standardizing commands — **canonical recipe names, project-local bodies**. Groups: build/run, testing, Docker Compose, quality (`lint`, `outdated`, `vuln`), versioning (`version`, `bump-*`), release (`changelog`, `release`, `package`), `clean`. Document each with a leading `# <description>`; the default recipe runs `just --list --unsorted`.

Copy `.ai/examples/dotnet/justfile` and customize the top-of-file variables. Host-specific recipes ship as `[unix]` + `[windows]` pairs, so no WSL is needed; tool-specific ones ship as stubs with per-OS examples in comments.

Full recipe list, install (just ≥ 1.20) and CI setup: [`justfile-recipes.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/justfile-recipes.md)

---

## Docker

- Runtime base: `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0-alpine`
- Build base: `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0-alpine`
- Multi-stage Dockerfile always
- Run as non-root user in final stage
- `docker-compose.yml` — production-like config
- `docker-compose.override.yml` — local dev overrides (ports, volumes, hot-reload)
- Secrets via environment variables or Docker secrets — **never in image or appsettings**

Dockerfile scaffold: [`.ai/references/dotnet/dockerfile.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/dockerfile.md)

---

## Logging & Observability

Serilog via `UseSerilog()` with `{ModuleName}` / `{CorrelationId}` on every entry; OpenTelemetry traces to OTLP; `/metrics` in Prometheus format; `/health/live` + `/health/ready`. Config detail: [`logging-observability.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/logging-observability.md)

**12-Factor enforcement points — violating these breaks production:**

- Never write to the container filesystem for application state
- Never put secrets in `appsettings.Development.json` — environment variables only
- EF Core migrations run as a separate init container or pre-deploy step — **never** auto-migrated on `app.Run()`
- Serilog sink in production is stdout or OTLP — never a file sink in Docker

---

## Security (stack baseline)

Base security rules live in `base-instructions.md`; this is how they are enforced on this stack:

- HTTPS + HSTS in **all** environments
- Response headers: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`
- Secrets via `IConfiguration` bound to environment variables — never `appsettings.json`
- `dotnet list package --vulnerable --fail-on-severity high` in CI
- Boundary validation with FluentValidation, before any domain logic
- Error responses are `ProblemDetails` — never raw messages

---

## Versioning (stack binding)

Base rules (SemVer, Conventional Commits → bump mapping, git-cliff) live in `base-instructions.md`. For this stack:

- One global version for all assemblies — defined once in `Directory.Build.props` as `<Version>`, never in individual `.csproj` files
- Docker images tagged with the same version + `latest` on stable releases

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions baseline)

Pipeline stages: `build` → `test` → `security-scan` → `docker-build` → `push` (base CI rules apply): build/test on every PR, vuln scan fails on HIGH/CRITICAL, image pushed only on `main` after tests pass.

Layer-specific CI jobs (E2E with Playwright for Blazor, k6 perf smoke for WebAPI) are added by the layer overlay.

Workflow scaffold: [`.ai/references/dotnet/github-actions.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/github-actions.md)

---

## Project Scaffold Checklist (.NET baseline)

.NET-specific init-time checklist (inherits the base checklist) lives at [`.ai/references/scaffold-checklists.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/scaffold-checklists.md) under "**.NET baseline**". Layer additions are in the same file.

---

## Agent Guardrails (.NET baseline)

In addition to the base guardrails:

- Do not install additional NuGet packages without asking first
- Do not change project target frameworks
- Do not modify `.csproj` files unless the task requires it
- Do not introduce new patterns (e.g. MediatR, CQRS) unless explicitly asked

### Never generate (this stack)

- `async void` (except UI event handlers — see the Blazor layer)
- `Task.Result` or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` — always `await`
- Magic strings — use `const` or `nameof()`
- Direct `HttpClient` instantiation — always via `IHttpClientFactory`
- Cross-module project references (use shared interfaces)

---

[//]: # (Stack layer — composed with .ai/stacks/_partials/dotnet-core.md by `make build-stacks` to produce .ai/stacks/dotnet-webapi.md. Do not edit the generated file directly.)

# .NET WebAPI Layer

Backend-only ASP.NET Core REST API projects (no Blazor/UI), composed on the shared `dotnet-core` partial.

---

## Tech Stack (WebAPI additions)

REST · ASP.NET Core Minimal API · `Asp.Versioning.Http` (URL-segment) · auth: pass-through / API-key / JWT (single scheme per project) · `ProblemDetails` (RFC 9457) · OpenAPI + Scalar at `/scalar` · Bruno · `WebApplicationFactory` + Testcontainers · k6 · Kiota.

Full table: [`.ai/references/dotnet/tech-stack.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet/tech-stack.md)

---

## API Design — Minimal API (WebAPI additions)

Endpoint grouping, one-handler-per-file, FluentValidation at the boundary, and
`ProblemDetails` errors are baseline — see the `dotnet-core` partial above. On top of that:

- Route prefix `/api/v{version}/{module}/...` — URL format under *API versioning* below
- `201`/`202` carry a `Location` header; use `422` (not `400`) for semantic validation failures; `429` carries `Retry-After`
- **GET with a request body is forbidden for new endpoints** — undefined semantics (RFC 9110), so proxies and caches may drop it. Use query params, or `POST /search` for large/sensitive filter sets.
- `ProblemDetails` gains a `traceId` extension from the current `Activity.TraceId`

Status codes, GET-body rationale, ProblemDetails registration: [`http-conventions.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/http-conventions.md)

---

## API Versioning

`Asp.Versioning.Http` with **URL-segment** versioning, format `v1.0` / `v2.1` (`MAJOR.MINOR`). The minor segment stays in the URL even when only the major bumps, keeping URL shape stable.

- **Unversioned URLs are backward-compatibility only** — they resolve to v1.0 explicitly, never "latest". Shipping v2.0 must not change what an unversioned caller hits.
- Deprecate with `.HasDeprecatedApiVersion(1.0)` plus a `Sunset: <RFC 7231 date>` header; removal is a separate step, never without an announced sunset window.

Registration scaffold: [`api-versioning.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/api-versioning.md)

---

## Authentication

**One scheme per API project**, chosen at bootstrap and applied to every endpoint — never mixed:

- **Pass-through** (BFF / wrapper APIs) — forward `Authorization` upstream verbatim; do not validate, decode, or log it, and register no scheme. Any non-proxied endpoint disqualifies the project.
- **API key** — `X-API-Key` header only, no query-string fallback; constant-time compare (`CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals`); keys in a secret store.
- **JWT bearer** — validate issuer, audience, lifetime and signing key in **every** environment, local included; authorize via named policies, not raw roles. This API consumes tokens; issuance belongs to a dedicated identity service.

`[Authorize]` / `.RequireAuthorization()` is the default for API-key and JWT projects. Anonymous endpoints are limited to `/health/*`, `/scalar`, and the OpenAPI document.

Per-scheme rules: [`authentication-schemes.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/authentication-schemes.md)

---

## Pagination

**Default to cursor-based** for new endpoints (offset is unstable under concurrent inserts): `GET .../orders?pageSize=50&pageToken=<opaque>` → `{ "items": [...], "nextPageToken": "<opaque>" }` (null when exhausted).

- `pageToken` is opaque base64 of an internal cursor (`{lastId, lastCreatedAt}`), never a row offset
- `pageSize` bounded server-side; over-limit requests return `400`
- Offset pagination only for small bounded admin lists where insert-stability is guaranteed

## Idempotency for unsafe methods

Accept `Idempotency-Key` on `POST`/`PATCH` (and `DELETE` if it has side-effects beyond removing a row).

- Cache the response keyed by `(route, key, principal)` for 24 h
- Same key → cached response returned (no duplicate side-effect, no second `201`)
- Same key but a *different* request body → `409 Conflict`
- Keys are client-supplied opaque strings; the API never generates them

---

## Optimistic concurrency

For mutable resources, surface the row version as an `ETag` and require `If-Match` on writes.

- `GET /resources/{id}` returns `ETag: "<rowversion>"`
- `PUT|PATCH|DELETE /resources/{id}` accepts `If-Match: "<rowversion>"` — present + mismatch → `412 Precondition Failed`; absent → write proceeds (lenient default; clients opt in by sending the header)
- EF Core: `[Timestamp] public byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }`; the handler maps `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` to `412`

---

## Rate limiting

- Named policies per endpoint group — never a single global limit
- Always emit `Retry-After` on `429`
- Partition by authenticated principal first; fall back to remote IP only for anonymous endpoints

---

## CORS

- Explicit origin allowlist per environment via `WithOrigins(...)`
- **Never** combine `AllowAnyOrigin()` with `AllowCredentials()` — browsers reject it; it signals a misconfiguration
- Scope methods and headers to what the API accepts — no blanket `AllowAnyMethod()`
- Preflight cache via `SetPreflightMaxAge(TimeSpan.FromHours(1))`

---

## HTTP logging

**Never log** `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Set-Cookie`, `X-API-Key`, or any header that may carry credentials. Calling `RequestHeaders.Clear()` before adding a curated allowlist is **mandatory** — the framework defaults include sensitive headers.

---

## Long-running operations

For work too long for one request: the kickoff `POST` returns `202 Accepted` + `Location: /api/v1.0/operations/{opId}`; polling `GET` returns `200 OK` (`running | succeeded | failed`) in progress, then `303 See Other` + `Location: <result-resource>` on completion. Retain operations ≥ 24 h so clients can observe the terminal state.

---

## Response compression

- Brotli first, gzip fallback
- Exclude already-compressed media types (`image/*`, `application/zip`, `application/x-protobuf`, etc.) — wasted CPU otherwise

Registration scaffold: [`.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/response-compression.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/response-compression.md)

---

## OpenAPI & Scalar

- API metadata (Title / Version / Description / Contact / License) is **mandatory** — published APIs without it are rejected in review
- Scalar UI at `/scalar`; OpenAPI document at `/openapi/v1.0.json`
- Code samples for **bash curl** and **PowerShell** at minimum
- Deprecated endpoints carry `deprecated: true` *and* return a `Sunset` header

Registration scaffold: [`openapi-scalar.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/openapi-scalar.md)

---

## Client SDK generation

**Kiota** is the default for first-party `.NET` and `TypeScript` consumers:

```bash
kiota generate -l CSharp -d https://api.example.com/openapi/v1.0.json -o ./clients/dotnet -n Acme.Orders.Client
```

- Other languages consume the OpenAPI document directly
- Do **not** introduce NSwag, Refit, AutoREST, or hand-rolled `HttpClient` wrappers without an explicit ask — the OpenAPI document is the contract

---

## Testing (WebAPI additions)

Unit-test conventions and the baseline `<Module>.UnitTests` / `<Module>.IntegrationTests` layout live in the `dotnet-core` partial. No bUnit, no Playwright — those are Blazor-stack concerns. An optional `tests/Api.ContractTests/` pins an OpenAPI snapshot.

- **Integration** — `WebApiFactory : WebApplicationFactory<Program>` swaps real infrastructure for Testcontainers. Each test class owns its database; no shared mutable state. Auth in tests registers a test scheme injecting a known principal — never call the real identity provider. Scaffold: [`integration-test.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/integration-test.md)
- **Manual / exploratory** — Bruno collections in `bruno/`, one folder per module, committed. Base URLs and tokens come from Bruno environments, never hardcoded; update the request in the same PR as the endpoint. Layout: [`bruno-layout.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/bruno-layout.md)
- **Performance / load** — k6 scripts in `perf/`, named `<endpoint-or-journey>.<profile>.js` (`smoke | load | stress | soak`). Every script declares `thresholds` for `http_req_duration` and `http_req_failed`; a failed threshold fails CI. Smoke blocks every PR, the rest run on demand. Layout + sample: [`k6-scenarios.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/dotnet-webapi/k6-scenarios.md)

## Project Scaffold Checklist (WebAPI additions)

WebAPI-specific init-time checklist (inherits the base + .NET checklists) lives at [`.ai/references/scaffold-checklists.md`](https://github.com/freaxnx01/ai-instructions/blob/main/.ai/references/scaffold-checklists.md) under "**.NET WebAPI**".

## Agent Guardrails (WebAPI additions)

Every rule in this layer is enforced as written above. One additional guardrail:

- Do not create POST or PATCH endpoints without considering whether `Idempotency-Key` should be supported
